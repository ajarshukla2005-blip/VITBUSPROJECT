# Project Statement

## Problem Being Solved

A lot of students in our college have confusion about:
- Which bus route to take for their area
- Bus timings keep changing or are hard to find (PDFs, images in random groups)
- Keeping track of attendance is tough, especially when lectures are at odd timings and for some subjects it’s hard to remember if we attended

Many times, students miss the right bus or have trouble meeting the minimum attendance percentage.

## Objectives

- Make a single, simple text-based app for students to:
  - See bus routes and detailed timings for each stop
  - Search for their stop and know what time to catch bus
  - Mark attendance for today (Present/Absent), then see attendance percent and if they’re at risk
  - User login system so attendance isn’t mixed
- Keep things as simple as possible, only standard Python and local files

## Real-World Impact

- Helps students be a little less dependent on WhatsApp or random notes/pictures for bus information
- Lowers the number of times students miss class due to not knowing bus schedule
- A small nudge every day to mark attendance and watch out for falling below the cutoff
- Privacy-friendly (nothing is tracked online – all data local)
